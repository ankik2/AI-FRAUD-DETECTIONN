## 🧾 About

Fraud detection is a critical component in finance, banking, and e-commerce. This AI-powered solution uses supervised learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions by analyzing historical patterns. The system improves accuracy through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and optimized model selection.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name:** [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Size:** 284,807 transactions  
- **Fraudulent Transactions:** 492 (Highly imbalanced)
- **Features:** Time, Amount, anonymized V1-V28, Class (0 = legit, 1 = fraud)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

We explored and compared multiple models:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost / LightGBM
- Isolation Forest (optional for unsupervised setting)
- Neural Networks (for deep learning variant)

> Model tuning was done using GridSearchCV and Cross-validation.
